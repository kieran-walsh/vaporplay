# Vaporplay
A web app that lets users turn songs into vaporwave (i.e., control the speed of audio files)

### About this project
- A "just for fun" project I did on my own time
- Custom CSS to make the web page look like Windows 95
- Using the JavaScript Web Audio API to load audio files into buffers for processing
